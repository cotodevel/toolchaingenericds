"Non-endorsement" clause states: 

A non endorsement license such as the three clause BSD, prohibit reusers from suggesting that derived data or analysis has any 
official status and clarifies that the data publisher does not endorse the actions of its reusers.

(so when fatfs is updated I can keep updated/tested drivers off the box), that's all. Kudos for such great work.
