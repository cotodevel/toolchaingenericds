Context Menu
------------

  This example shows how to create and interact with context menu items.
  
  In the example, shoulder-clicking (ie. holding L or R and tapping) the textbox
  will cause the context-sensitive menu to appear.  It contains 4 items.
  Selecting one of the items will cause the value of the item to appear in the
  textbox.
