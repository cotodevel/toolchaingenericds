Timer
-----

  This example shows how to create an instance of the WoopsiTimer class and use
  it to control VBL/time-based effects.
  
  In the example, a textbox shows individual lower-case letters sequentially
  from a to z.  Every 10 frames, the text box updates to show the next letter in
  the sequence.
