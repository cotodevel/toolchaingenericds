	/**
	 * GraphicsPort is the interface between a gadget and the framebuffer.  It
	 * provides drawing tools that are clipped to the visible regions of a
	 * gadget.
	 *
	 * All drawing co-ordinates should be submitted in GraphicsPort space.
	 * GraphicsPort space is relative to the x and y co-ordinates given to an
	 * instance of the GraphicsPort class via its constructor.  The width and
	 * height parameters define the size of that space.  The x and y
	 * co-ordinates submitted to the constructor should be relative to the
	 * gadget.  The getClipRect() method returns the rect in GraphicsPort
	 * space.
	 *
	 * Internally, all co-ordinates are converted to Woopsi-space for
	 * manipulation. However, when drawing all co-ordinates are converted from
	 * Woopsi-space to framebuffer-space.
	 *
	 * This class can only draw to one of the DS' framebuffers.  This means that
	 * a gadget cannot span both of the DS' screens.  If a gadget attempts to
	 * span both screens (as in the case of the Woopsi gadget), any drawing will
	 * be done to the bottom display only.  Drawing commands that should take
	 * effect on the top display will simply be clipped out.  This is why the
	 * Woopsi class creates two blank screens as backgrounds in its constructor
	 * and does not include any drawing commands.
	 *
	 * A workaround for this limitation is to manually create a new graphicsport
	 * in your gadget's draw methods and force it to use the top display's
	 * framebuffer.  You can then direct drawing commands to the upper display.

		/**
		 * Constructor.
		 *
		 * The x, y, width and height parameters define the area within which
		 * the GraphicsPort can draw.  These should represent the co-ordinates
		 * of the gadget, or an area within the gadget, expressed in
		 * Woopsi-space co-ordinates.  A gadget's co-ordinates in Woopsi-space
		 * are given by its getX() and getY() methods.  The width and height
		 * parameters are given by the getWidth() and getHeight() methods of the
		 * gadget.
		 *
		 * To limit drawing to an area within a gadget, add the co-ordinates of
		 * the area to the values returned by getX() and getY().  For example,
		 * to create a GraphicsPort that will not draw within any of the pixels
		 * from co-ordinates (0,0) to (0,12), the x parameter should be:
		 *
		 *    getX() + 12
		 *
		 * When the co-ordinates are increased, the width must decrease.  The
		 * appropriate width for the above situation is:
		 *
		 *    getWidth() - 12
		 *
		 * In most circumstances, x/y/width/height should reflect either the
		 * dimensions and co-ordinates of the gadget or the area inside its
		 * border.
		 *
		 * @param x The x co-ordinate of the region into which the graphics port
		 * can draw.
		 * @param y The y co-ordinate of the region into which the graphics port
		 * can draw.
		 * @param width The width of the region into which the graphics port can
		 * draw.
		 * @param height The height of the region into which the graphics port
		 * can draw.
		 * @param isEnabled Set this to false to disable all drawing commands.
		 * @param bitmap The bitmap that the port will draw to. 
		 * @param clipRectList An array of clipping regions within which the
		 * class must draw.  If set, clipRect must be NULL.
		 * @param clipRect The clipping region within which the class must draw.
		 * If set, clipRectList must be NULL.
