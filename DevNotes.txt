Compare and exchange:

When accessing timing dependant memory such as the shared region independently from ARM cores, the API must implement atomic read/write functions...
otherwise, because of a mixture of cache and compiler optimizations (consisting of optimized subsequent I/O accesses), ARM cores semaphore compare and exchange 
methods will fail.
