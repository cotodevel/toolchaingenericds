March/02/2019:

DSWNIFI was reworked a bit. Now everything is wrapped properly and the DSWNIFI context runs from DTCM.


Upon testing:

DS Phat, DS Lite and (normal) DSi = dswnifi works both UDP and LOCAL.

DSi XL, 3DS, N3DS = dswnifi freezes upon some activity. This bug has happened since 2018 or so. Todo: check why and fix that.
